        >Adult bears are solitary and usually avoid contact with humans; however, they may attack if starving or to protect cubs. Bears are hunted for their skins and flesh. The flesh of polar bears in particular often contains trichina worms, which can be transmitted to humans if the meat is not thoroughly cooked . Polar bears and grizzly bears have been affected by the loss of habitat due to global warming and human encroachment on their territory.

    <p>They are definitely big, and yes, they are very strong.  They can be scary, but most will only become aggressive when threatened or when their babies are threatened and even then many species of bear won’t attack.
    Bears are solitary and quite docile animals that have been given a bad reputation.  They are smart, shy and are great at hiding when they need to.</P>
